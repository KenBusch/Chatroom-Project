# 🚀 Deploy Your App Right Now

## Simplest Option: One-Time Deployment

Since you just need to deploy once and the website will stay live, here's the easiest way:

### Option 1: I'll give you exact commands (2 minutes)

You'll need to:
1. Download this repo from GitHub
2. Open terminal and navigate to the folder
3. Run these 3 commands:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase deploy
```

That's it! Your app will be live at: **https://chatroom-app-3d4f2.web.app**

### Option 2: Automatic Deployment (Only if you plan to make changes)

If you think you'll update the app later, I can set up GitHub Actions so every time you push code, it automatically deploys. But this requires adding a secret to GitHub.

**Which do you prefer?**
- Just deploy once manually (Option 1)
- Set up auto-deployment (Option 2)
